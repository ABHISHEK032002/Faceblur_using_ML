To detect multiple faces and blur them in a group of peole, we can use the two below mentioned classifiers, which have there own positives and negatives , which are outlined as follows:


>>> Haar Cascade Classifier:

Speed: Haar features are simple to compute, making them very efficient for real-time applications.
Accuracy: Relies on handcrafted features which might not capture the full complexity of faces, leading to:
False positives: Detecting objects that aren't faces.
False negatives: Missing actual faces, especially with variations in pose, lighting, or occlusion.

Preprocessing:

Often uses grayscale images as Haar features are less sensitive to color variations.
May involve image scaling to ensure features are detected at different sizes.
Minimal preprocessing is needed, contributing to its speed advantage.


>>> MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Network):

Accuracy: Utilizes a multi-stage Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture that learns complex features from training data. This leads to higher accuracy in detecting faces with: Different poses (frontal, profile, etc.), Varying lighting conditions, Partial occlusions (glasses, hats)
Speed: CNNs involve complex mathematical operations, making them computationally expensive. This results in slower processing compared to Haar cascades.

Preprocessing:

Typically uses RGB images as CNNs leverage color information for better feature extraction.
May involve image normalization (adjusting brightness and contrast) for consistent processing across frames.
Data augmentation techniques like cropping and flipping faces can be used to improve training data diversity.
